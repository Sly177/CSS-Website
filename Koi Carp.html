Koi is an informal group name of the colored variants of C. rubrofuscus. There is a description of koi with color variation in ancient Chinese literature, but many varieties of koi for ornamental purpose, which are now known around the world, originated from the breeding that began in Niigata, Japan in the early 19th century during the Edo period.[1][2][3] Several varieties are recognized by the Japanese. Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, and cream. The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made up of the Kohaku, Taisho Sanshoku, and Showa Sanshoku varieties.
